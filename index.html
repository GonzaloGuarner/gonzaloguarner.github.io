														<h3>Zig Zag Pro</h3>

													<p> A first soon-to-be Google Play submission. Tap to zigzag across the increasingly challenging levels or challenge yourself for a new highscore in endless procedurally generated runs. LiveOps through the use of Microsoft's Playfab, backend with LootLocker, monetization, skin customization and engaging level design were new areas I could dive into and enjoy while developing this project.  </p>

														<h3>The Fuzzing Swarms:</h3>
														<h4> Particle Swarm Optimized Fuzzy Logic Controllers for Deployment of Swarm Agents.</p>
													</header>
														<p> Swarm Intelligence models the collective behaviour of self-organized systems, usually following the paradigm that set natural swarms, such as ants or bees. Developing this project was the core of my study at the Master of Game Technology at the Breda University of Applied Sciences. The use of Fuzzy Logic Controllers optimized through a metaheuristic (PSO) was studied to efficiently conduct a dynamic swarm deployment, a fundamental task in swarm applications.</p>

														<h3>Predicting Complex Community Dynamics from Computer-Generated Simulations</h3>
													</header>
													<p>This project was the subject of my bachelor's thesis, but I had been exploring the concept of digital entities capable of being 'alive' for a couple of years prior to it. Concretely the goal was to reproduce complex behaviour reported by different bacteria communities in various scientific papers. The use of maths and complex systems theory for physical system's modelling is as fruitful as ever.</p>

														<h3>Cacao: bringing the board game online</h3>
													</header>
													<p>Playing board games with friends can make for the best afternoons. During 2020 however, lockdown and restrictions complicated things for our group of friends:  keeping on playing one of our favourite games was no longer possible. This is where I decided to team up with a fellow programmer friend to make an online replica of Cacao. Having a well-defined game design, I also used this opportunity to further improve my knowledge in object-oriented programming, particle systems, animations and tile interaction.</p>

														<h3>Planet Racer Clone</h3>
													</header>
													<p>Remaking this classic flash game allowed me to go through many layers of game development. Areas such as UI, art, game physics, game flow and the shopping system were developed while following the original game's structure. Sprite design, procedural race generation and believable movement controls were features I could experiment with, with satisfying results.</p>

														<h3>Snake Rubik Cube Solver</h3>
													</header>
													<p>After giving up on a 9-colour snake cube I was challenged to solve, I realized I could make a computer work for me. The rules were rather simple, build the cube without having two cubes of the same colour in any side. With the help of my laptop the tides turned quickly: with a rather simple algorithm for parsing the tree of possible configurations, trying hundreds of thousands of configurations was reduced to just 70 mseconds! And the one and only solution was found.</p>

														<h3>HEX Clash</h3>
													</header>
													<p>My first big project in video game development, a turn-based civilization game based on the popular Hexonia. It's hexagonal grid map allowed me to apply physics knowledge outside of academia for the first time, as I used algebraic operations to quickly work with the geometry of the world. The development of this project introduced me to pathfinding algorithms, simple game AIs and random map generation with Perlin noise, among others. The character models come from a 3D printing repository I used at the time.</p>
